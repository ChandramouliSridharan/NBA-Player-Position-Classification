# NBA-Player-Position-Classification
We classified NBA players into 5 positions on the basketball court based on the players' per-game average performance in a regular season.
The dataset is in a CSV file "nba_stats.csv".

**Tasks Performed:**

Used many classification method on the dataset (for example : Decision Tree/Naive Bayes/KNN/SVM) and found SVM method has the highest accuracy among all.

Applied 80% of the data for training and the rest for validation. 

Calculated the training and validation set accuracy of the model. Also, verified using the confusion matrix for both training and validation sets.

With the sample "dummy_test.csv", applied our model and calculated the accuracy and confusion matrix on dummy test set.

Applied 10-fold stratified cross-validation and determined the average accuracy across all the folds.
